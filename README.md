### Hi, i'm a computer science student at FCUL and i'm studying to be a computer engineer.

I really like to program and I'm always looking to learn new concepts, both related to computing and others outside my area.

During my academic journey I have earned a few degrees of merit including a university one and participated in some extracurricular computing projects. I also like to do some individual work related to programming.

I am currently gaining knowledge and experience in this area.
